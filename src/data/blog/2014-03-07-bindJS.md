## Using bind() in Javascript

This article is an attempt to give further explanations on
**Function.prototype.bind**,  
first explaining which problems it solves and then showing how it could
help design  
software.

### Bind

Bind is a function of the **Function** prototype which has the following signature : `Function.prototype.bind( newThis, [arg1, arg2, ...])`

Let’s put aside the optionnal parameters for now. When this method is
applied on a  
function it creates a new function on which the **this** object context
is definitely set.

Here is a small sample you can execute in your browser:

```javascript
//in a web environment
function a() { console.log(this) }
a(); // prints out the window

var b = a.bind({ foo : “bar”});
b(); // prints out the object { foo : “bar”}
```

When the function a is called, it uses the default environment object  
which is `window`. `bind` call creates a new function and sets the
`this`  
of the function to some random object here. b call prints out this
object.

As I stated earlier it has also this interesting side effect of setting
`this` for good.

```javascript
// We continue on the previous environment
a.call({baz : “bar”}); // prints out {baz : “bar”}
b.call({baz : “bar”}); // prints out {foo : “bar”}
```

`call` runs the function it is applied on with `this` set to the
first parameter  
given to it. Given that a and b are basically the same functions, one
could have  
expected to receives the same output. And this is not the case here.
`Bind` is behind  
the scene changing the value of `this` dynamically before the function
is actually  
called.

There is a case I encountered in which I needed `bind`. But it wasn’t
obvious to me  
at the time. I wanted to be able to use `console.log` directly as a
callback. But I  
couldn’t because the browser was throwing some ‘illegal invocation’
exception.

```javascript
console.log(”toto”); //Prints french foo bar toto ;)

// Let’s say we want to inspect some event objects in a programmaticway
// You could try this
document.body.addEventListener(”click”, console.log);
// but it won’t work, throwing a dreadful ‘illegal
// invocation’ Exception

// Another approach
document.body.addEventListener(”click”, function consoleLogProxy(){
console.log(arguments);
});
// it doesn’t report a correct line number

// The solution :
var log = console.log.bind(console)

document.body.addEventListener(”click”, log);
```

In the first attempt, an illegal invocation exception was throwned
because  
`log` wasn’t executed with the `console` context.

The second example is a classic way to do the job. But in this
particular case,  
it has a problem, the browser console won’t report the correct line
number. If  
this function is a util function of your framework in this fashion, the
line number  
reported by the console will always be the one where the console.log is
called. And  
this is not very very useful.

### Beyond this

`bind` takes a variable number of arguments. Each of these other  
arguments are set the same way `this` is set for the future calls  
on the newly created function.

```javascript
var logHello = console.log.bind( console, “Hello”);
logHello( “Peter” ); // output \> “Hello” “Peter”
```

Although the first argument may solve some headaches related to
`this`, the other  
arguments allow a whole bunch of software design tricks. One may use
functions as a  
way to create high level behaviours and then use bind to fill in the
gaps.

This is the killer feature lying into bind.

### Designing with functions

The classical example for such design is addOne. Let’s consider the
function  
`add`, which takes two numbers and return the sum of it. `AddOne` is
the  
function that takes one number and return the sum of this number and
one. This  
is how it looks :

```javascript
var add = function add(n, m) {
  return n + m;
};
var addOne = add.bind(null, 1);

addOne(2); // 3
```

To be honest, this example always left me with the feeling it was
useless. If you  
feel me, here is another one I believe is better. It is about making
stuff, be it  
a tasty cake or a cool machine. Here is how it all start :

```javascript
var makeLemonPie = function () {
  var ingredients = getIngredients();
  var lemonPie = lemonPieRecipe(ingredients);
  return lemonPie;
};

var makeRobots = function () {
  var parts = getParts();
  var robot = robotPlans(parts);
  return robot;
};
```

The first part of designing is to look for similarities. We have two
functions  
that create stuff. First they fetch some ingredients and then use a
recipe function  
to combine them and then return the resulting stuff.

The common pattern can therefore be extracted into a more generic
function :

```javascript
var make = function (formula, getIngredients) {
  var ingredients = getIngredients();
  var product = formula(ingredients);
  return product;
};
```

And then it can used to create robots and lemon pies.

```javascript
var aRobot = make(robotPlans, getParts);
var aLemonPie = make(lemonPieRecipe, getIngredients);
```

As long as we provide the recipe and some resource provider,
everything  
works fine. But if we were to share this code with a third party, they  
would have to know about everything, the formula/recipes and the
ingredients  
provider. Instead, we can use `bind` to provide a proper API.

```javascript
// Maker module
var robotM = require("./robot.js");
var cakeM = require("./lie.js");

var make = function (formula, getIngredients) {
  var ingredients = getIngredients();
  var product = formula(ingredients);
  return product;
};

module.exports = {
  makeRobot: make.bind(null, robotM.robotPlans, robotM.getParts),
  makeLemonPie: make.bind(null, cakeM.recipe, cakeM.getIngredients),
  abstractMake: make,
};
```

The `make` function is a general one. It describes a process,
something that  
is, by nature, abstract. It is a very high level vision of the
making/baking  
process. It doesn’t hold any assumptions on objects that will be built
in the  
future. There are no constraints on which ingredients are required nor
on the  
output.

People call this form of specialization of functions currying or
partial  
application. And as you can see, it is a poweful way to structure code
in a  
functionnal style.

### Bound callbacks

I want to finish this post with a way to rewrite a very common pattern.
When  
passing a callback function which is already, we may want some
parameters to be  
already passed. The common practice is to define an anonymous function.
But it  
gets a bit abstract.

Let’s consider the following function :

```javascript
function a(n) {
  console.log(Data.now(), n);
}
```

This function prints the execution time and the value passed in the
first  
argument. The date is not relevant for now.

Let’s take `setTimeout` as the callbacked API for the next example on
how would be the  
common practice. It is not really a very _real life_ example but most of
us  
are familiar with its use. Here it is :

```javascript
a(0);
setTimeout(function () {
  a(5);
}, 5000);
```

The first call to a prints the time followed by 0. The second call,
after about 5 seconds,  
prints the time (with 5 or more seconds more than the previous call),
followed by 5.

We had to create a new function just to be able to preset one value,
this is a bit verbose.  
And in this kind of states we might be tempted to try shortcuts. Such as
:

```javascript
a(0);
setTimeout(a(5), 5000);
```

The problem here is that the second invocation is evaluated right away,
not after 5 seconds.  
This is shown by the inside call to `Date.now()` that is logged to the
console, not 5 seconds  
but milliseconds after. It is very much like we did this :

```javascript
a(0);
a(5);
```

Hopefuly we have `bind` to help for doing correct and elegant code :

```javascript
a(0);
setTimeout(a.bind(null, 5), 5000);
```

The code in this case is strictly equivalent to the first solution. But
beware, you have to  
keep in mind that `bind` will create a new function which holds
reference to parameters. This  
might lead to memory leak.

### Conclusion

Bind is powerful, elegant, leads to a whole new world of program design
and solve some problem  
with callbacks. Use it, this is good!
