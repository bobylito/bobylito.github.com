In 2025, I participated to the jamuary. This is a yearly event in which during a month, artists from all over the world make some music and publish it. From what I've seen it's mostly amateurs and in the electronic music space.

I did several jams for this year. For all of them I used a combination of my oxi one with a setup of synths and sampler on my ipad. All the instruments and mixing is done using Aum.
