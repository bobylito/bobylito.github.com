My name is Alexandre Valsamou-Stanislawski. Born in the 80's (in the 20th century), I love many people, animals, topics and things. I am likely to write about :

- programming and other computer stuff
- music and generative art
- communities and society
- the world (god forbid I might write about politics)

Oh and I'm French (I saw you could have guessed from the accent), and yet I write in English (globish even). I may change that in the future, but this feels quite natural currently.

## A word about the design

This site is based on AstroPaper, a minimal, responsive and SEO-friendly Astro blog theme. If you like this theme, you can star/contribute to the [repo](https://github.com/satnaing/astro-paper).
