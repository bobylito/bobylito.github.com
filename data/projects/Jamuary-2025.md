In 2025, I participated to the jamuary. This is a yearly event in which during a
month, artists from all over the world make some music and publish it. From what
I've seen it's mostly passionate people in the electronic music space.

## My setup

The core of the setup is the Oxi One plugged on an iPad with Kynematic Aum for
mixing and hosting plugins.
