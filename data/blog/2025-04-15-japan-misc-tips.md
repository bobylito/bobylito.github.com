It's not as easy or magical as youtube videos will tell you, and yet it is very practical. I recommend using it.

### The system

While travelling in Japan, you can use the Yamato transport to have your luggages deliver
at your next step. It is very convenient and useful :
 - the stations can be quiet busy
 - the elevators/escalators may not be practical
 - the trains only accept smaller luggages or you need to book a specific tickets to have a spot on the "big luggage" space

The system is called Ta Q Bin (takioubine) and it is widely known. You can send your luggage from your hotel or a local "combini" (minimarket)
like Family Mart or 7/11.

### The caveats

- not all hotels accept luggages via TaQBin
- it's quite daunting to send luggage the first time
- you need to tick a special box for sending to yamato office or a combini
- most likely you will be able to have "same day" delivery so you need to plan ahead

### The tips

- you can send in advance your luggage in advance, so think about skipping a step in your travels

> eg : we travelled from Osaka to Takayama, to spend 2 days there, and then off to Kyoto. We sent the luggages directly to Kyoto, saving money and stress :D

- use the map to locate the stores that allow shipping your luggage (in case your hotel does not want to do it) : https://locations.kuronekoyamato.co.jp/p/yamato01/

- check the right check box if you are sending to either a Yamato office or combini (mini market)

- track your luggage with the code on the waybill : https://track.kuronekoyamato.co.jp/english/tracking

- use the japanese version to get more infos in case of issues : https://toi.kuronekoyamato.co.jp/cgi-bin/tneko and use firefox (or even better ZenBrowser) for offline japanese translation of the website
