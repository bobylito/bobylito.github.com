A few years, I built a game : a city builder with Reigns like vibe. The game was initiated to promote the concept of charter cities, a concept that I am not aligned with, now that I know more about the political implications. Nonetheless, I am still intrigued by such a game and I would love to revisit it.

## What I liked

 - the simulation
 - the UI
 - the social feed

## What I did not like

 - no political option, you cannot steer
 - simplistic gameplay loop
