During my April 2025 Japan trip, I went to the Ghibli park. This visit was most
anticipated as a fan of the animation studio. I was a bit shaken by the approach
of this park and in the end I was glad I went there. This page is about my
experience and a warning to any western first time visitors of the park.

## How to get tickets?

Before going there, you need to know something, it is hard to get tickets and
very unpractical when you are plannign months ahead.

The reservations open two months before. For example, July 2025 reservations
will open on May 10th 2025, 2PM JST. You can find the next opening on the
official website : https://ghibli-park.jp/en/ticket/

To actually book tickets, you need to get to a third party website, either
Lawson or Klook. I really recomment Klook as it seems more westerners friendly.
In my experience, I had no queue and the availability was updated in real time.
Be there before it opens.

## Which ticket take?

The one you can get :)

NOTES :

- normal vs o-sanpo tickets : access to totoro village big miss :heartbreak:
- it's a pieces of parks in a bigger park : it's great fun for kids not only in
  the ghibli gated zones
- time flies, we could only do 2 of the 3 zones we had access to. Imagine with
  more!!
- the pace is great, it's refreshing that pictures are not allowed in most
  places
- tour operator will get you the full package with a premium
