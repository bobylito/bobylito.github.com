# Paris JS #41

Last night was the 41st session, and it was a very good one. Not only because I
did my first talk but because the community was awesome as ever. This post is a
small report of this edition.

## The talks

As usual with ParisJS, the subjects were very diverse. Both backend and frontend
had their share. Two were real life examples, one was an experiment.

The first talk (mine) was about _ReactJS and Games_. This is a report of an
ongoing experiment using ReactJS to create a game. It started with an oriented
introduction to ReactJS and the implementation of several gamedev patterns using
ReactJS. You can find the slides on
[SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/bobylito/react-and-games)

The second talk was made by [Jacopo Daeli](https://twitter.com/JacopoDaeli) and
he introduced us to Node Webkit. He showed us the benefits of having a platform
which brings together the backend and front end together in one programming
space. With node-webkit, you can use html/css and friends to build a UI that
will rely on robust API from Node to interact with the system.

Last but not least, [Laurent Perrin](https://twitter.com/l_perrin) made a
presentation about ContentEditable. As they say in the movies, great powers
means great responsability, the other word for trouble. And content editable is
no exception. The intents of the API are great but some aspects were neglected
so we end up pile of hacks when in need for a text editor in the browser.
Hopefully, Laurent gave us his tricks in this talk. Slides are available on
[slides.com](http://slides.com/laurentperrin/contenteditable#/) and the source
code is on [github](https://github.com/lperrin/talk-contenteditable).
