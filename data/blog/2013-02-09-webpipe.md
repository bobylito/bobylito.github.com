## Binding worlds using Scala/Play/Javascript

Today's sample project is all about using existing bricks, adding glue and
letting the magic happen. But be careful, I'm using cool stuff and wonderful
pieces of tech but I don't intend to explain them by the menu.

So ok, I have a project, it is wonderful and awesome and... Let's stop there and
explain a bit further. It is a server which reads its **standard input** and
streams that to a webpage **it is also serving**. The idea of this POC server is
to bind command line tool and a web server, in order to do something like this :

```sh
$> tail -f apache_access_log | webPipe
```

This outputs the content of the Apache access log to the web through server sent
events as the file log grows. By the way, the _webPipe_ command is an alias to
the command that launches the server.

The code is in Scala and uses Play 2.1. It also contains just the right amount
of javascript code (for the size of this project).

The project code is [here](https://github.com/bobylito/webPipe) (we'll go
directly to the specific parts during the article).

### The root of all things

Reading the standard input of the application is straightforward, thanks to
[scala.io](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.io.package)
and especially
[scala.io.Source](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.io.Source),
both included in the standard library.

```scala
val stdIn = scala.io.Source.stdin
```

Returns the standard input as a
[scala.io.BufferedSource](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.io.BufferedSource).
We can then use its api to read line by line :

```scala
val lines = stdIn.getLines
```

This returns a brand new
[scala.collection.Iterator\[String\]](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.Iterator)
. Now we can have some fun and start using the
[Play Framework](http://www.playframework.org) .

### Enumerate the input

The internals of Play2 don't play along with Iterators. They use other data
structures for having non blocking, reactive processing. For more infos on this
subject, I would recommend that you read
[Mandubian's article](http://mandubian.com/2012/08/27/understanding-play2-iteratees-for-normal-humans)
(it is not mandatory to read it to understand the rest of this post though)

Long story short, we introduced a new function to the Enumerator object that
actually give the ability to take any _TraversableOnce_ (which represents any
kinds of stuff you might want to iterate on) and transform it to an Enumerator,
which is what Play understands.

For example :

```scala
val enumLines = Enumerator.enumerate( lines )
// returns Enumerator[String]
```

To be real life compliant, we can actually want json data structure (makes life
easier afterward) :

```scala
val enumLines = Enumerator.enumerate( lines.map( { l =>
    play.api.libs.json.Json.toJson(l)
} ) )
// returns Enumerator[JsonValue]
```

Actually this isn't quite enough to send stuff to many clients. In order to do
that, we need to use _play.api.iteratee.Concurrent.broadcast_.

```scala
val (broadcast, _) = play.api.libs.Concurrent.broadcast(enumLines)
```

This gives us an enumerator we can use for streaming for any client (the
underscore is an object used to control the broadcast itself, useless here).

Check how it looks
[in the app](https://github.com/bobylito/webPipe/blob/master/app/controllers/Application.scala#L12-18)

### Feed me!

With an Enumerator in our pocket, we are already half way through this example.
Actually, now we want to serve it and it'll be quite fast. Be ready :

```scala
ok.feed(enumLines &\>
play.api.libs.EventSource).as("text/event-stream")
```

BAMM, the controller now returns the feed as EventSource!! Bravo!

### Not your usual client

The feed is feeding but we are not yet eating.

```javascript
new EventSource("/log");
EventSource.addEventListener("message", function () {
  // ...
});
```

to see how it is used in the project.

### Conclusion

In less than 20 lines of actual code, this demonstrates we can push the command
line to the web and use the play2 web framework as a command line tool. Hope
you'll have fun playing with all these stuff. If you have any questions,
