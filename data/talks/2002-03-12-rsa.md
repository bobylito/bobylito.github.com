Le RSA is one of the two first talks I ever gave.

It features a massive misundertanding of what is a scientific poster. In the era
of pornochic for the fashion advertisement the "poster" of my talk uses one of
them to play on Math with or without jeans topic. It was too fun not to do, but
maybe I should have made a proper poster.

It shows a clear will to make such a dry topic more fun.
